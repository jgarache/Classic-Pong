# Classic-Pong

I recreated the classic "Pong" while studying "Game Programming in C++: Creating 3D Games."

Objective:
Pong is a two player 2D game with the objective of knocking the ball into the other persons side. The program will terminate after the ball crosses one of the two players sides.

Controls:

Player 1 - "w" Up and "s" down
Player 2 - "i" Up and "k" down
